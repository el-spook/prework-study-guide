# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is a place for me, a web development bootcamp student, to find notes on what I've learnt in the prework modules. 

It is structured so that I can easily find and read the information I want to find or review. It keeps a lot of information together in one place under four separate headings. It also makes a suggestion about what to study next.

In order to make the webpage, I used HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

## Usage

There are four sections: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. Under each heading there are notes on the topic which can be used to help with learning and revision.

In addition, if the user opens the DevTools console on the site (by pressing Command+Option+I on macOS or Control+Shift+I on Windows), they will see a list of the topics. There will then be a topic selected randomly as a suggestion for what to study first. By refreshing the page, different topics will be suggested.
